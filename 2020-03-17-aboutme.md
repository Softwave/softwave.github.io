Hello... seeing as that the world is in chaos right now, I figured I would let people know some things. The thing I wanted people to know about me and why I've disappeared is: 

I am transgender ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* . 

This means that I do not see myself as a man, and I have not since I was very small. Truthfully, seeing myself as and being seen as a woman is what feels internally "correct" to me. 

I have been on hormone replacement therapy since September 12th. 2019. 

I am a woman.
