At this page is a selection of small computer programs that I have written that can be quickly downloaded and run (or used online) and that don't fit super well being published on a game development site or as only source code on GitHub. Basically, little programs and utilities in binary-form will find their home here. For computer games, check out my [itch.io](https://softwave.itch.io/).

## Utilities

- [Radix.jar](Radix2.jar) - [_Java_] A tool for converting numbers from one base into another. IE: decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal. Responsive online replacement is [here](https://www.s0ftwave.com/radix-app/).
- [FibGui](FibGui.zip) - [_Win64_] A small GUI-based Windows program for calculating Fibonacci numbers. Only works on 64-bit Windows systems. Written entirely in x64 assembly language.
- [Factui](Factui.zip) - [_Win64_] GUI-program that displays the first 20 numbers factorial. Written in x64 assembly language.
- [CharCnt](CharCnt.zip) - [_Win64_] A GUI-based tool to count characters. Also written in x64 assembly language.

## Cool Toys/Demos

- [BlazingMandelbrot](BlazingMandelbrot.zip) - [_Win32_] Program that displays a cool, fiery version of the Mandelbrot fractal.
- [GlowingJulia](GlowingJulia.zip) - [_Win32_] Another fun fractal-y program! This time using a version of the Julia set!

## Web Utilities

- [Radix](https://www.s0ftwave.com/radix-app/) - [_Web_] Responsive program written in TypeScript with the Aurelia framework for converting numbers from one base to another.
- [Image-Glitcher](http://www.s0ftwave.com/image-glitcher/) - [_Web_] Single page application to glitch images; made with React and prototyped in Figma.

## Web Toys/Demos (that are cool!)

- [Sorting Algorithms](https://www.s0ftwave.com/sorting-algorithms/) - [_Web_] Several popular sorting algorithms visualized!
