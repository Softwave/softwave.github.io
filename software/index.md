At this page is a selection of small computer programs that I have written that can be quickly downloaded and run and that don't fit super well being published on a game development site or as only source code on GitHub. Basically, little programs and utilities will find their home here.

## Utilities

- [Radix.jar](Radix2.jar) - [_Java_] A tool for converting numbers from one base into another. IE: decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal. Responsive online replacement is [here](https://www.s0ftwave.com/radix-app/).
- [FibGui](FibGui.zip) - [_Win64_] A small GUI-based Windows program for calculating Fibonacci numbers. Only works on 64-bit Windows systems. Written entirely in x64 assembly language.

## Toys/Demos

- [BlazingMandelbrot](BlazingMandelbrot.zip) - [_Win32_] Program that displays a cool, fiery version of the Mandelbrot fractal.
