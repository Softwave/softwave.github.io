At this page is a selection of small computer programs that I have written that can be quickly downloaded and run and that don't fit super well being published on a game development site or as only source code on GitHub. Basically, little programs and utilities will find their home here.

## Utilities

- [FibGui](FibGui.zip) - [_Win64_] A small GUI-based Windows program for calculating Fibonacci numbers. Only works on 64-bit Windows systems. Written entirely in x64 assembly language.

## Toys/Demos

- [BlazingMandelbrot](BlazingMandelbrot.zip) - [_Win32_] Program that displays a cool, fiery version of the Mandelbrot fractal.
