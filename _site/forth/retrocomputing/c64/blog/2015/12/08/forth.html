		<p>A long time ago I briefly played with the programming language Forth.</p>

<p>I remember it being a revelatory experience and being on of the first
languages I could understand to any real degree. That said it’s not
exactly a widley used language today and I haven’t really had an
excuse to play with it again until recently.</p>

<p>That excuse was discovering <a href="https://github.com/jkotlinski/durexforth">durexForth</a>,
a modern Forth implementation for the Commodore 64.</p>

<p>You can draw graphics, create music through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language">MML</a> notation,
draw sprites - do a large number of things that isn’t (practically) possible through Commodore BASIC, all while
being a more powerful and expressive, but also <em>faster</em> language.</p>

<p>It’s been a lot of fun playing around with so far, and I’ve been impressed by Forth the language for its ease of use
combined with expressivity. I find that programming in Forth feels a lot like building an operating system or
language of your own design. Like you are building upwards from small pieces. I guess similarly to how scheme feels,
but lower level.</p>

<p>I’ve used it both through VICE and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/q4WWq">through a real C64</a> (software loaded from an <a href="http://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/">sd2iec</a>) and it’s probably the most fun I’ve
had actually programming <em>on</em> a C64 - versus cross-compiling.</p>
