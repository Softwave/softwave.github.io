    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    My name is Jessica (you may also call me 'Serene') and I'm an amateur computer programmer and game developer, an appreciator of bats 🦇, and also someone who has made it a point of pride to be always steadfastly archaic. In the world of computing I have particular interests in creative coding, computer graphics, and software as art. I love old computers and programming for them.<br><br>  

    I am a Christian 🕇 and I love (particularly Anglican) theology, liturgy, and practice. Sometimes I draw or make music, and I plan on learning to sew. I also love writing bad romance stories in my spare time.<br><br>  

    I use she/her pronouns and I support you.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️<br><br>   

    If you've curious as to what "Softwave" means, your guess is as good as mine: it's what I've called my website and is the name under which I've participated in game james and the like for some time.<br><br>   

    I hope you enjoy things I've put on here, whether they be comptuer programs or otherwise, and I hope you have a nice day. :)
