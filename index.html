    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    My name is Jessica and I'm a Jesus and (Anglican) theology enthusiast, an amateur computer programmer and game developer, an appreciator of bats 🦇, and also someone who has made it a point of pride to be always steadfastly archaic. In the world of technology I have a particular passion for graphics, design, the history of computing, and the notion of code as art.<br><br>  

    In my spare time I write bad love stories and cry about them. <br><br>  

    I use she/her pronouns and I support you.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️<br><br>   

    If you've curious as to what "Softwave" means, your guess is as good as mine: it's what I've called my website and is the name under which I've participated in game james and the like for some time.<br><br>   

    I hope you enjoy things I've put on here, whether they be comptuer programs or otherwise, and I hope you have a nice day.
