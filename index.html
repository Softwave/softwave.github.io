    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    My name is Jessica (you may know me by various other names) and I'm an amateur computer programmer and game developer, an appreciator of bats 🦇, and also someone who has made it a point of pride to be always steadfastly archaic. In the world of computing I have particular interests in creative coding, computer graphics, and software as art. I love old computers and programming for them.<br><br>  

    I am a socialist and believe everyone should be able to have a quality life and that we can have a society with no oppression of any kind. I am a Christian ✝️ and I love theology and liturgy, and am a laywoman in The Episcopal Church.</a> Sometimes I draw or make music, and I plan on learning to sew. I also love writing schlocky stories in my spare time.<br><br>  

    I use she/her pronouns, and I support you.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️<br><br>   

    If you've curious as to what "Softwave" means, your guess is as good as mine: it's what I've called my website and is the name under which I've participated in game jams and the like for some time.<br><br>   

    I hope you enjoy things I've put on here, whether they be computer programs or otherwise, and I hope you have a nice day. :)
