      <h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>In this page I wanted to share the state of my current computing setup. It'll be updated (with timestamp as well) regularly. As someone who spends a lot of time working with computers, having a comfortable and efficient computing environment is very important to me, and the customisation of such a setup is also, frankly, part of the fun of computing.</p>
<h3>Workstation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name: Discovery</li>
<li>Case: Fractal Design Focus 2</li>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12400F @ 5.6GHz</li>
<li>Memory: 32GB Corsair</li>
<li>Storage: 1TB M.2/1TB SATA</li>
<li>OS: Fedora 38/Windows 11</li>
<li>Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE">NsCDE</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Discovery&quot; is the first PC I've ever built on my own. It was quite a bit easier than I'd expected it to be, and very rewarding as I have a computer that fit my budget and needs. I'd needed something with more GPU-power, after years with an old Dell business PC, and a 2013 MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll need a laptop -- most likely an Apple silicon MacBook.</p>
<h3>Peripherals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mouse: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B071YZJ1G1/">Logitech MX Master 2S</a></li>
<li>Keyboard: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Wireless-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B09YY9GVD4">Keychron K6</a> with Glorious Panda switches and spherical keycaps</li>
<li>Number pad: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZNVLQSR">Epomaker TH21 Numpad</a> with Gateron Yellow switches</li>
<li>Display: Two old monitors from past computers I'd owned, 1080p, I don't need much in this area.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Editor: Emacs (<a href="https://github.com/Softwave/emacs.d">dotfiles</a>) &amp; <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">Micro</a></li>
<li>Terminal: XFCE-4 Terminal</li>
<li>Fonts: IBM BIOS-2y from the <a href="https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/">IBM Oldschool PC Font Pack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst I enjoy Windows 11 well enough, most of my time these days is spent in Linux.</p>
<p>For the past few years I've edited text in Visual Studio Code, which is wonderful, but I have recently switched back to GNU Emacs for this purpose. It seems like Emacs isn't as popular as other editors these days, but I just enjoy being able to setup my environment precisely how I want. VSCode is still a stellar editor that I recommend to all.</p>
<p>My choice of NsCDE as my desktop environment has several motivations. The retro environment is aesthetically pleasing to me, but also brings to mind my first encounters with computers in the days of classic macOS and Windows9x. It also brings to mind the Unix workstation of yore, something I have always wanted, and that somehow also evokes feelings of the system being a serious computing machine and less a toy/consumer plaything. All that, but just in a modern context where I work heavily with graphical and compute-intensive things.</p>
