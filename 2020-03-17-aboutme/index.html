      <p>Hello... seeing as that the world is in chaos right now, I figured I would let people know some things. The thing I wanted people to know about me and why I've disappeared is:</p>
<p>I am transgender ✧･ﾟ: <em>✧･ﾟ:</em> .</p>
<p>This means that I do not see myself as a man, and I have not since I was very small. Truthfully, seeing myself as and being seen as a woman is what feels internally &quot;correct&quot; to me.</p>
<p>I have been on hormone replacement therapy since September 12th. 2019.</p>
<p>I am a woman.</p>
