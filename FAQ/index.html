      <h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Last Updated: 2025-02-15</strong></p>
<p>Some responses to questions I am often asked.</p>
<h2>What are your system specs?</h2>
<p>I run a dual-boot of Fedora Linux and Windows 11 on a mid-range-ish desktop computer I've built that I call &quot;Discovery&quot;. Frequently people think I must have some monstrously powerful computer, in reference to a few videos (link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbIiAr5dt24">1</a>, &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmshJmQ6o90">2</a>) I've done where I've pointed out the speed of computers, but it really isn't so. Computers, just, in a very general kind of way, are very fast. My computer suits my needs, presently, and I'm happy with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> Discovery</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-12400F @ 4.4GHz (6 cores, 12 threads)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB Corsair</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> RTX 3060 w. 12GB vRAM</li>
<li><strong>Case:</strong> <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/focus/focus-2/white-tg-clear-tint/">Fractal Design Focus 2 (White)</a></li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB M.2, 1TB SATA</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is that terminal you're using?</h2>
<p>In some of my videos I've used <a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">cool-retro-term</a>, a terminal emulator that emulates a CRT television. It might be silly, but I find it fun and reasonably aesthetically pleasing. Otherwise, I use xfce4-terminal, that comes with the XFCE desktop environment. On Windows, I simply use the default Windows terminal, sometimes with the CRT shader setting applied.</p>
<h2>What is that font you're using?</h2>
<p>For my terminal and editor(s), I usually use any of a number of fonts from <a href="https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/">The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack</a>. I particularly like IBM BIOS-2y.</p>
<h2>How does your desktop look like that?/What desktop environment do you use?</h2>
<p>I very much enjoy using <a href="https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE">NsCDE</a>. It's a modern version of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment">CDE</a> desktop from the 90s, and I love it. I love to have a look that brings to mind an old Sun workstation, and NsCDE does that splendidly.</p>
<h2>What keyboard do you use?</h2>
<p>I use a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K6</a> with <a href="https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches">Glorious Panda switches</a> and KBDFans SA profile Violet PBT keycaps. I like it, but it's a bit loud for my tastes. My next keyboard will be quieter.</p>
<h2>What is the deal with the fibonacci program?/Can I have it?</h2>
<p>It's a little program I wrote in C. It calculates the nth fibonacci number quickly and to an arbitrary level of precision using <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>.</p>
<p>You can download an updated version of it (with additions from others) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19FvhL4qVsdOkje3qaNA1w60DPgu5OjlS/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>. There is also an MS-DOS port, there. The original gist is <a href="https://gist.github.com/Softwave/f61091aed8c8d8249014b5056447a698">here</a>.</p>
