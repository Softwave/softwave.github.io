[Drifter](https://softwave.itch.io/drifter) is an experimental exploration game I made with Unity in May of 2015. It’s not finished and I’ve wanted to either update or (more likely) completely re-do it for a long time. That said, I’m proud of the aesthetic and feeling of the game.

The music is “Thunder Dreams” by [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/).
