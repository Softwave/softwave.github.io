title: About me

Hello! My name is Jessica Leyba and I love computers. I am a developer living in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am interested in creative coding, computer graphics, computer games, design, photography, and software as art. I daydream constantly and want to use the computer to make the worlds I imagine in my head real. I intend to contribute more to open source projects in the future. Really what I want to do is make things.
