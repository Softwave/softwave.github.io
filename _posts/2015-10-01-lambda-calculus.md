In my last post I had mentioned that I was playing around with [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/), and since then things have spiraled into me actually making a [Bandcamp page](https://lambdacalculus.bandcamp.com/) to share music I've made. 

I'm also learning [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/), Sonic Pi's more powerful, Clojure sibling. In general I've been making an effort to properly learn lisp.
