title: "Playing with Forth on the C64"
---

A long time ago I briefly played with the programming language Forth.

I remember it being a revelatory experience and being on of the first
languages I could understand to any real degree. That said it's not
exactly a widley used language today and I haven't really had an
excuse to play with it again until recently.

That excuse was discovering [durexForth](https://github.com/jkotlinski/durexforth),
a modern Forth implementation for the Commodore 64.

You can draw graphics, create music through [MML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language) notation,
draw sprites - do a large number of things that isn't (practically) possible through Commodore BASIC, all while
being a more powerful and expressive, but also *faster* language.

It's been a lot of fun playing around with so far, and I've been impressed by Forth the language for its ease of use
combined with expressivity. I find that programming in Forth feels a lot like building an operating system or
language of your own design. Like you are building upwards from small pieces. I guess similarly to how scheme feels,
but lower level.

I've used it both through VICE and [through a real C64](http://imgur.com/a/q4WWq) (software loaded from an [sd2iec](http://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/)) and it's probably the most fun I've
had actually programming *on* a C64 - versus cross-compiling.
