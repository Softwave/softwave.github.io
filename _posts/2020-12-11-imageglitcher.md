I made my first React app! A single page application made with React for glitching out images. I used Figma to prototype the design and create-react-app to get a boilerplate going. I plan on learning more and trying to use modern JavaScript frameworks to make more little projects like this one. 

You can check out the app [here](http://www.s0ftwave.com/image-glitcher/) or the code [here](https://github.com/Softwave/image-glitcher).
