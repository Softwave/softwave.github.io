The following is a collection of resources and tools for Commodore 64 development. If it's on this list I consider it worth checking out at the very least; most of these things have proven invaluable to me. 

### Books, Guides, Wikis and Cheatsheets

* Commodore 64 Programmers Reference Guide - The original Commodore programming book. Can easily be bought on eBay. Can also be found for free online but I don't know about the legality of that.
* [Easy6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) - A wonderful resource for learning general 6502 programming in the browser
* [6502 Memory Map](http://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html) - Extremely useful
* [Codebase 64](http://codebase64.org/doku.php) - C64 programming Wiki, very useful
* [C64 Wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/Main_Page) - Lots of resources here


### Programming

* [Dust](http://dustlayer.com/) - Excellent tool for C64 programming on the Mac
* [cc65](http://cc65.github.io/cc65/) - C compiler for the 6502; targets the C64 by default
* [CBM prg Studio](http://www.ajordison.co.uk/) - Complete IDE for C64 programming on Windows
* [Relaunch64](http://www.popelganda.de/relaunch64.html) - Cross platform C64 IDE written in Java
* [ACME](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/) - The assembler I mostly use; comes with Dust
* [DASM](http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/) - A nice 6502 assembler
* [Kick Assembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.php) - I have not tried but it looks interesting
