title: Hello World on the C64
---

Programming for the Commodore 64 is fun. Of all 8-bit, retro systems, I think, by far, the C64 has the most and the best development tools.

The Commodore 64 is basically extremely mainstream by retrocomputing standards - new software is being written literally daily for a 35 year old computer. Most development these days is done through cross-asselmbers. I personally prefer [Kick Assembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html), mostly for its advances macro and other features. 

 
This [Kick Assembler Package for Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Kick%20Assembler%20(C64)) is very useful. You'll also want to have an emulator of course. I recommend [Vice](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/). 

The following is an extremely simple program that makes the screen black, the text white, and prints "HELLO WORLD!" to the middle of the screen. 

I'll add more examples when I have the time. 

```nasm
BasicUpstart2(start)

// Entry point
* = $4000
start:
    // Make screen black and text white
    lda #$00
    sta $d020
    sta $d021
    lda #$01
    sta $0286
    // Clear the screen and jump to draw routine
    jsr $e544
    jsr draw_text
    jmp *


msg:
    .text "              hello world!              "

draw_text:
    ldx #$00
draw_loop:
    lda msg,x
    sta $05e0,x
    inx
    cpx #$28
    bne draw_loop
    rts
```


This results in the following program (here running on Vice):
