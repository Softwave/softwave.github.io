Lately I've been playing with [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/), a delightful Ruby-based language for livecoding music. 

I have a hard time making music with traditional software but somehow am able to code it - it's easier.

#Pegago - one of my first Sonic Pi songs

with_fx :ixi_techno, mix: 1, phase_slide: 4 do
  with_fx :reverb, mix: 0.8 do
    live_loop :dthing do
      sample :bass_thick_c
      sample :bass_thick_c, rate: 2
      sample :bass_thick_c, rate: 4
      sample :bass_thick_c, rate: 0.5
      sample :bass_thick_c, rate: 0.25
      sleep 4
    end
  end
end


live_loop :noodle, delay: 2 do
  ns = (scale :C4, :jiao, num_octaves: 3).take(3)
  use_synth :prophet

  with_fx :reverb, room: 1, reps: 4 do
    4.times do
      play ns.choose, release: 0.5, detune: 12, 
      amp: rand + 0.5, cutoff: rrand(20, 80)
      sleep 0.5
    end
  end
end

It's a ton of fun and a great way to waste time.
