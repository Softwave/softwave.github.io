[Lambda Calculus](http://lambdacalculus.bandcamp.com/) is my project for creating algorithmic music. I presently use [Sonic-Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) and [Overtone](https://overtone.github.io/) to program mostly atmospheric tracks. L.C. is an off and on project - hopefully Iâ€™ll have time to do more with it in the future.
