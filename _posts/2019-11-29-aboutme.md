So... as it turns out, I am a transgender woman. I guess this is kind of a coming out post. I have known this about myself for years and years - I have known I was trans and contextualized it in that manner for about ten years now. Even before then, it's always been there (even without me quite understanding it as transness). I have been on HRT since September 12th. 2019 and my only regret is that I didn't start sooner.
