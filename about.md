Hi, I'm Jessica and I'm a Jesus and (Anglican) theology enthusiast, an amateur computer programmer and game developer, an appreciator of bats 🦇, and also someone who has made it a point of pride to be always steadfastly archaic. In the world of technology I have a particular passion for graphics, design, the history of computing, and the notion of code as art. 

In my spare time I write bad love stories and cry about them. 

I use she/her pronouns and I support you.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ 

I hope you enjoy things I've put on here, whether they be comptuer programs or otherwise, and I hope you have a nice day.
